# Description

This is a basic flocking simulation, with agents that follow the three principals of flocking: Cohesion, separation, and alignment. It has been optimized with a quad tree, and the user has the ability to select units with the mouse and give them destinations.

# Usage

To run the program, simply open the index.html file in a browser. Units can be selected by left clicking and dragging to specify a region of selection; then they can be given a destination by right clicking.
